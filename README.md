Removing the file writing and JSON conversion steps simplifies your web scraping project in Go. The project now focuses solely on fetching, parsing, and extracting data from a web page. Here's a detailed description of each step in this revised project:

### Step 1: Fetching Web Content (`fetch` Function)

- **Purpose**: The primary goal of the `fetch` function is to retrieve HTML content from a specified URL. This is the first and crucial step in the web scraping process.
- **Implementation**: This function uses Go's `net/http` package to make an HTTP GET request to the target URL. It handles the response by reading the HTML content from the response body.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to catch any issues during the HTTP request, like network errors or incorrect URLs.

### Step 2: Parsing HTML (`parseHTML` Function)

- **Purpose**: Once the HTML content is retrieved, the `parseHTML` function is responsible for parsing this HTML into a structured format that can be programmatically navigated and manipulated.
- **Implementation**: The function utilizes the `goquery` library, which allows you to load the HTML content and create a `goquery.Document`. This document object provides methods to traverse and search the HTML using CSS selectors, similar to jQuery.
- **Role in Data Extraction**: The parsed HTML document serves as the foundation for the subsequent data extraction process.

### Step 3: Data Extraction (`extractData` Function)

- **Purpose**: The core of the web scraping project, the `extractData` function, is responsible for extracting specific information from the parsed HTML.
- **Implementation**: This function iterates over elements in the `goquery.Document` that match certain criteria (defined by CSS selectors) and extracts the required data, like text or attributes.
- **Data Structure**: Extracted data is typically organized into Go structs that reflect the structure of the information you are scraping. For example, if scraping book details, you would define a `Book` struct with relevant fields (title, price, rating, etc.).

### Step 4: Main Function (`main.go`)

- **Workflow Coordination**: The `main` function orchestrates the entire scraping process. It calls the `fetch` function to get the HTML content from the web, parses this content with `parseHTML`, and then extracts the necessary data using `extractData`.
- **Error Management**: It also manages errors returned from each of these functions, ensuring that any issues are logged, and execution is stopped appropriately.


### Summary

This streamlined project offers a concise yet comprehensive introduction to web scraping with Go. It covers the essential aspects of fetching web content, parsing HTML, and extracting specific data. This setup is ideal for scenarios where you need to process or use scraped data immediately within your application rather than storing it for later use.
